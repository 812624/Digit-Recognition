Implemented Digit recognition on MNIST dataset.
- This is a menu based application, where model is trained using Backpropagation Algorithm.
- Test your own images taken on real time through your webcam.
Takes images using package "image-acquisition".
- It is 2 layer Neural Network, having 100 hidden units and 10(0 through 9) labels as the output.
mnist.m file has the driver code.
- trained.mat is generated after training the model and all parameters are saved in this file after training the moodel, for further uses to predict unknown images.
